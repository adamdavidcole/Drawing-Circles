# Drawing Circles

Drawing Cirlces is a creative coding experiment in light, shape and sound. This project took a shape I previously created in javascript as a starting point, and expanded on that geometry through repetition, color and interactivity. The goal was to take advantage of the power of C++/openframeworks in ways that are not possible in javascript. 

Using the song "Drawing Circles" by Mac Miller as a backdrop, a smoothed out FFT representation of the song powers both the size and intensity of color of the central shape. You can also move your mouse around to shift the focoal point of it. The result is a shape which feels eerily organic, pulsating along to the song in an amibugous ethereal manner.
